/**
 * DiffDrive — closed-loop differential drive for the Nezha brick.
 *
 * Student-facing units: cm, cm/s, degrees, degrees/s. Positive yaw is
 * counter-clockwise (right wheel forward). Pose is (x, y, heading) in
 * robot start coordinates: x forward, y left.
 *
 * There is no dedicated motor fiber: the robot only moves while
 * something keeps ticking the control loop (driveTick(), or an
 * internally-ticking block like move()/goTo()) -- see driveTick()'s
 * own doc comment. The functions exported below are the real
 * block-API bodies, calling into the hardware shim layer (the .cpp
 * files); the browser-simulator fallbacks live in sim.ts.
