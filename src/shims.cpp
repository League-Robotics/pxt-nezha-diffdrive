// kernel (self-contained control law) with two NezhaMotorPorts and the

//
//   - ODOMETRY: differential dead-reckoning from the kernel's Output
//     positions (the kernel is counts-native and has no chassis
//     geometry; track width and travel calibration live HERE).
//   - MOVE ENGINE: position-mode moves (distance+yaw, and goto via the
//     TS layer's arc math) as a start/update/end state machine over the
//     kernel's velocity interface. The TypeScript layer polls
//     updateMove() -- blocking and loop-style forms are both built on
//     that poll. Both updateMove() and the tick engine below share one
//     implementation, service().
//   - TICK ENGINE: tickDrive() runs one kernel.step() + service()
//     on the CALLER's own fiber, then self-paces to the next 24 ms
//     deadline. The kernel's own background fiber pacer
//     (start()/run()/fiberEntry()) is deliberately left unwired -- see
//     ensure()'s own comment -- so every control cycle now runs on
//     whichever fiber calls tickDrive() instead.
//   - STARVATION WATCHDOG: the one background fiber this file still
//     launches -- a safety net, not a control path; see its own

// (diffdrive.cpp) -- delivery to the motors happens solely on a LATER
// kernel.step(), and step()'s own duty write happens BEFORE its two
// ~4 ms-per-wheel encoder settle sleeps. A stop or move-completion issued
// from a fiber other than the one currently inside step()'s settle
// window therefore stages a neutral that is not delivered until that
// step() returns AND another step() runs -- which, if the very call that
// staged it is what ended a `while (tickDrive())` loop (the common
// case), never happens until the ~100-150 ms starvation watchdog fires:
// the same class of bug commit 3e919e5 fixed for the in-fiber
// (move-completion) case, reopened here for the cross-fiber case.
//
// This helper pushes an immediate, PORT-LEVEL zero write to both
// motors -- the exact primitive the starvation watchdog below already
// uses (NezhaMotorPort::emergencyStop(), proven tick-independent by its
