// motion_engine.h -- diffDrive::MotionEngine: the two-primitive reduction
// this project's motion surface is built on. Canonical spec (read-only,
// a different repo -- this project conforms to its grammar, it does not
// vendor its C++): radio-robot-lib/docs/design/motion-api.md S2
// ("Everything is constant-ratio wheel segments") and S2.1 ("b is the
// effective track width") are the whole design; read those two sections
// first.
//
// Host-portable by construction: this file and motion_engine.cpp include
// nothing but <cstdint>/<cmath> and diffdrive.h -- no pxt.h, no CODAL
// type, anywhere -- so the native host test harness (tests/host/) links
// and exercises this class with no micro:bit involved. Both call paths
// this codebase has -- the TypeScript block API (`blocks/`) via
// shims.cpp's engine* forwards, and the wire adapter (wire_adapter.cpp) via
// the same
// forwards -- share this one implementation instead of duplicating the
// math.
//
// TWO PRIMITIVES (motion-api.md S1/S2): wheelsX() (per-wheel commanded
// DISTANCE, ratio-locked to a cruise ceiling so both wheels finish
// together) and wheelsV() (per-wheel commanded VELOCITY, held for
// `duration` -- `duration` IS the kernel's own lease). Everything else
// in the six-operation Motion API reduces onto these two plus the
// geometry they both depend on; see each method's own doc comment below
// for units and contract. Both clear the move engine's own in-flight
// state first (see MOVE ENGINE below) -- motion-api.md S6: "wheels_*
// clears the planner."
//
// MOVE ENGINE (motion-api.md S3.3-S3.5). The taper/ramp/wrong-way-abort/
// settle SHAPING that used to live in shims.cpp's Rig::serviceMove()/
// startMove() moves here verbatim (algorithm unchanged, only its home
// and calling convention), restated as the three reductions:
//
//   moveX(distance, rotation, cruise, timeout) -- body distance [mm] +
//     heading change [rad] CCW+, reduced onto wheelsX's ratio math
//     (distance -+ rotation*b/2). |rotation| >= 50 deg
//     (kTurnFirstAngleRad, motion-api.md S3.3's measured
//     `turn_first_angle`) with a nonzero distance is NOT one segment:
//     pivot to the new heading first, then travel the remainder
//     straight -- queued internally as one caller-visible moveX() call.
//     A live encoder-progress check (not just the dead-reckoned lease
//     wheelsX alone provides) is what stops each segment on arrival;
//     `timeout` is a REAL backstop tracked independently of that,
//     spanning the whole call (both phases, if two).
//   moveV(vx, omega, duration) -- the plain wheelsV reduction, no
//     shaping (a velocity hold has no "end" to taper toward).
//   goToR(x, y, speed, arrive, timeout) -- the spec's arc reduction
//     (turn angle theta = 2*atan2(y,x), arc length motion-api.md S3.5),
//     but goToR OWNS its own pivot-vs-blend split decision rather than
//     inheriting moveX()'s generic one (sprint 006, KERN-02): moveX()'s
//     |rotation| >= 50 deg split reissues theta/arc-length as pivot-
//     then-straight, which lands at a DIFFERENT endpoint than the
//     blended arc whenever it fires (arc length != chord length except
//     in the limit) -- goToR() instead pivots to the line-of-sight
//     bearing (atan2(y,x)) then drives the straight-line chord
//     (hypot(x,y)), which reaches (x, y) exactly, by construction.
//     `theta` is normalized to the short arc, (-pi, pi], before this
//     split decision (and before the plain-arc branch below threshold
//     uses it) -- doubling atan2's own principal value can otherwise
//     land up to just under +-2*pi, which is "the long way around" the
//     same constant-curvature circle as the short, wrapped angle (both
//     reach the same (x, y), but only the short one is a sane distance
//     to drive); this is what keeps a target nearly directly behind the
//     robot from being driven the long way around a huge circle
//     (sprint 006, KERN-03). `arrive` is now honored as a radial no-op
//     gate (sprint 006, KERN-04): `hypot(x, y) <= arrive` issues no
//     segment at all -- still a single-shot reduction, not the
//     supervisory re-solving loop motion-api.md S3.5 describes; a caller
//     that wants that re-issues goToR itself. This heuristic-free
//     reduction remains distinct from this project's own goToWorld() in
//     `blocks/world.ts`, a separate, TS-level turn-first/capped-curvature
//     call path (sprint.md Design Rationale: two paths sharing one primitive,
//     not one implementation).
//   goToW(pose, x, y, speed, arrive, timeout) -- the WORLD-frame
//     counterpart: motion-api.md S3.6, "go_to_w(x, y) ==
//     read pose -> world-to-body -> go_to_r". Reads `pose`'s current
//     (x, y, heading), rotates the world-frame delta into the body frame,
//     and delegates to goToR() above -- same single-shot, no-
//     supervisory-re-solve posture, same separateness from goToWorld()'s
//     own TS-level heuristic. `pose` is a PoseSource reference supplied
//     PER CALL (see the PoseSource class below) -- motion-api.md S9.3
//     item 3: "go_to_w's pose source is pluggable rather than assuming
//     an OTOS is fitted", because the fleet is not uniform (S3.6's own
//     `gopiv` example has no OTOS at all). MotionEngine holds no
//     PoseSource of its own; the caller (a wire adapter, a shim) chooses
//     which one to pass, which is what makes this class host-testable
//     with a fake pose with no OTOS anywhere in the link.
//
// serviceMove() is the per-tick advance: callers (shims.cpp's
// updateMove()/tickDrive(), formerly Rig::serviceMove()'s only callers)
// invoke it once per control cycle while isMoveActive() to re-scale the
// taper/ramp, check completion/deadline/stall/wrong-way, and reissue
// kernel_.drive() every tick while active -- the same "cheap, lease-safe
// reissue" scheme the code it is extracted from used, because gating
// reissues on a scale CHANGE would let the lease expire during any
// steady phase. Odometry (Rig's x/y/heading) stays OUT of this class --
// it is a shims.cpp/Rig concern this ticket does not move -- so callers
// must update it themselves around serviceMove(), exactly as the code
// this is extracted from did inside the old free-function serviceMove().
//
// GEOMETRY (motion-api.md S2.1): `effectiveTrackWidth()` is a METHOD,
// deliberately never a stored field, computed as `trackWidth /
// rotationalSlip` every time it is asked for -- so a config read-back
// can never report a derived number as though it had been measured.
// `trackWidth` itself is NEVER "corrected" to make a turn land -- it is
// the one independently-verifiable number in the robot's geometry (a
// caliper reaches it). All rotational scrub correction belongs in
// `rotationalSlip`, separately measurable against camera truth; keeping
// the two apart is what lets a bad turn be diagnosed instead of merely
// compensated (S2.1, and this project's own standing rule -- see this
// repo's CLAUDE.md/sprint.md Success Criteria).
//
// SIGN CONVENTION, unchanged from the code this class is extracted from
// and from motion-api.md S2.1: CCW-positive. A positive twist/rotation
// turns LEFT and increases camera yaw; the left wheel is the slower one
// in a left turn. This is NOT re-derived from cable order anywhere in
// this file -- see tests/host/test_motion_engine_primitives.py's own
// explicit sign-convention tests, written so a future cable-order "fix"
// fails a test instead of shipping (this project has shipped that exact
// bug and patched it four times downstream).
