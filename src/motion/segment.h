// segment.h -- diffDrive::Segment: one constant-ratio motion-engine plan
// and its progress (design docs/design/motion-profile-unification.md
// S4.3). Replaces MotionEngine's old MoveState (motion_engine.h,
// pre-sprint-029): owns what a segment IS and how far along it is;
// never decides speeds itself -- that is VelocityShaper's job
// (velocity_shaper.h), driven by MotionEngine::service() (design S5).
//
// Host-portable by construction: <cstdint>/<cmath> plus
// "../core/diffdrive.h" only (for DiffDrive::DifferentialDrive::Output)
// -- no pxt.h, no CODAL type, anywhere.
//
// LAZY ORIGIN CAPTURE (design S6.5): a Segment is built with
// `originPending = true` and no drive() is ever issued at construction
// time. The first MotionEngine::service() call after start() -- which
// always follows that tick's own kernel_.step() -- captures
// posLeft0/posRight0 from THAT tick's Output and clears originPending.
// Between construction and that first step(), the wheels cannot have
// moved (nothing was commanded yet), and any rebasePosition() deferred
// before the segment started has, by construction, already been applied
// by that same step() -- so the segment's own origin is never stale.
// This retires the old MoveState's positionEpochLeft0/Right0 pair
// entirely: there is no rebase race left to guard against (design S6.5,
// S4.8).
