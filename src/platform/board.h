// board.h -- the compile-time board-composition seam.
//
// One literal, DIFFDRIVE_BOARD, decides which physical board this
// build composes against -- selected once, at compile time, the same
// way kChannel/kProfile/firmware_bake.motors already are
// (tools/make_deploy.py's own comment on this seam explains why a
// compile-time bake beats runtime 0x10 autodetection: two open issues
// on first-I2C-command wedges, and this fleet's identity-comes-from-
// something-baked rule). Absent a `geometry.firmware_bake.board` key
// (every fleet robot today), it defaults to Nezha, so an existing
// build is unaffected by this file's mere existence.
//
// This header is deliberately host-portable: the macro literal and the
// declarations below reach nothing but core/diffdrive.h (the Motor
// interface) and core/motor_wiring.h (the pure wiring decision), both
// already host-compiled. The TARGET-bound half of each board's own
// composition -- constructing real ports, writing the fault-context
// emergency-stop frame over real I2C -- lives in board_nezha.cpp /
// board_cutebot.cpp, not here; see those files' own header comments
// for which parts of THEM reach pxt.h.
