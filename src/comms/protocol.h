// protocol.h -- Protocol: the CODAL protocol fiber and byte plumbing
// between SerialTransport/RadioTransport and the v6 wire stack
// (wire_handler.h/.cpp, wire_adapter.h/.cpp). Knows nothing of the v6
// grammar, the reliability layer, or any verb's own behavior -- all of
// that lives behind wireHandler_/wireHandlerRadio_/wireAdapter_.
//
// One exception, preserved deliberately: the OLD cleartext
// "RUN:<name>[:<arg>...]" MessageBus bridge (handleRun()/runText()/the
// runQueue_ ring below) coexists with v6 on the same wire -- detected
// directly by its literal "RUN:" prefix before a line ever reaches the
// v6 stack (no verb registry involved -- see run()'s own comment). It
// is the ONLY path that feeds the MessageBus test-trigger bridge
// test.ts actually uses: v6's own RUN verb (wire_adapter.cpp's
// WireAdapter::onRun()) is kUnknown.
//
// The radio transport speaks the full v6 grammar too, through a SECOND
// WireHandler (wireHandlerRadio_, below) composed over the SAME
// wireAdapter_ instance the serial handler uses -- not a second
// adapter: two adapters would let a sequence gap on one transport nack
// the OTHER transport's next command, which is exactly the corruption
// the second-handler structure exists to prevent. The old-style
// cleartext RUN: carve-out above is preserved on radio too, as a
// fallback, unchanged -- see run()'s own radio-polling block.
// `emitLine()` below -- the free function shims.cpp's test-result
// reporting already uses -- queues onto a Protocol-owned ring rather
// than writing to either transport directly; this fiber's own loop
// drains it every pass. An untethered bench run's results still reach
// a listening host, just through one more level of indirection than
// before, and only ever written by this fiber.
//
// This project's own telemetry is real and shipped on the v6 wire
// stack: WireHandler::emitTelemetry(Snapshot) (see its own doc comment
// for the thdr/t frame format) replaces the old v5 cleartext
// "TLM:<ms>:..." line entirely. tools/tour_run.py, tools/tour_capture.py,
// tools/tour_watch.py, and this repo's other bench scripts read the
// thdr/t stream directly -- retrofitted onto it in full; no TLM:
// parsing remains anywhere in this tree.
