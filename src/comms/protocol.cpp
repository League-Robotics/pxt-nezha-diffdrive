//     fixed string here would stomp the registry across the fleet.
//   - serial: microbit_serial_number() -- genuinely unique per device.
//   - kDrivetrain = this extension's kinematic type (matches the
//     package name); kProfile = which robot's config this hex was
//     BUILT AGAINST -- deploy-time build-target selection, NOT board
//     identity (radio-robot-lib's per-robot config filename stem, e.g.
//     "vevov" or "tovez" -- matches the elite reference design's
//     Config::kRobotProfileName, "baked from the robot JSON's own ...
//     filename stem"). Injected per-robot at DEPLOY time, into the
//     SCRATCH COPY only, by tools/make_deploy.py's _inject_profile() --
//     the same scratch-copy-only substitution _inject_radio_channel()
//     performs for radio_transport.h's kChannel. This repo's own
//     checked-in literal below is therefore never a real fleet robot
//     name: it is the UN-BAKED default, so a build run with no
//     --robot (or built outside make_deploy.py entirely) cannot be
//     mistaken for, or impersonate, any board on the fleet. (Before
//     this injection existed, kProfile was a hand-written constant
//     frozen fleet-wide at "tovez" -- every board, including vevov,
//     reported "tovez" over ID. That was the defect this injection
//     fixes for BUILD PROVENANCE; it does not make kProfile board
//     identity -- `name` above (identity.name) is the wire's sole
//     authoritative board identity, because it is read from silicon at
//     call time and cannot be stale, whereas `profile` is only ever as
//     correct as the build that produced it. `profile` and `name` can
//     legitimately disagree on one ID reply: `profile` says which
//     robot's config the hex targeted, `name` says which physical
//     board is actually answering. That disagreement IS the
//     diagnostic -- it means this board was flashed with the wrong
//     robot's build -- so never "fix" it by forcing the two to match.
//     Note this also decouples kProfile from shims.cpp's Rig tuning
//     defaults -- which bake those constants are actually measured
//     from is a separate, currently-contradictory question, tracked as
//     its own issue, not settled by this constant.)
