// wire_handler.h -- Wire::WireHandler: protocol v6's ASCII line-grammar
// mechanics (radio-robot-lib/docs/design/protocol.md S2, S2.1, S3.1,
// S3.2) PLUS the reliability layer (S8, S8.9 -- the canonical spec; this
// project conforms to that grammar, it does not vendor radio-robot-lib's
// C++). feed() reassembles arbitrary byte blocks into '\n'-terminated
// lines, tokenizes each line in place on runs of ' ' (no allocation, no
// std::string -- S3.2), enforces case-as-direction (S2.1: commands
// UPPERCASE, replies lowercase, verb lookup case-SENSITIVE), and
// dispatches every verb this project currently implements: the four
// unsequenced exemptions (HELLO, PING, ESTOP, HELP -- S8.3) plus the
// eight non-motion sequenced verbs (ID, VER, STATUS, GET, SET, TLM,
// STOP, RUN).
//
// HELP joined the unsequenced set on 2026-08-27 by stakeholder
// direction. It is a human-typed diagnostic verb -- the FIRST thing an
// operator types into a raw relay session -- and requiring a `#<id>`
// on it meant a bare `HELP` was silently dropped, which is exactly the
// wrong answer for the one verb whose entire job is telling a confused
// operator what to do next. It is forgiving like PING: any arity, with
// or without an id, always answers.
//
// ---- The reliability layer (S8), in one paragraph ----
//
// Every sequenced verb carries a MANDATORY trailing id, `#<n>`, that is
// also a strictly incrementing sequence number starting at 1. Handler
// state is EXACTLY one value -- expectedNext_ (next id expected;
// gapOutstanding_ is GONE, 2026-08-26, S8.5: its only reader was the
// deleted telemetry ack piggyback) -- deliberately no
// clock and no timer anywhere (S8.1): feed() stays a pure function of
// its input bytes plus this small state. dispatch() resolves the id
// FIRST, against expectedNext_, classifying every inbound id into
// exactly one of three cases (S8.1's table):
//   - id == expectedNext_ : decode the verb's own fields FIRST (S8.9);
//     only if decoding succeeds does the sequence advance
//     (expectedNext_ = id + 1) and `ack <id> <lastDone> <reason>` go
//     out. A decode failure at this point -- unrecognized verb, wrong
//     arity, or an unparseable field -- does NOT advance the sequence:
//     it replies `nack <expectedNext_> <lastDone> <reason>` (still
//     naming the SAME id, since it was never accepted) plus
//     `err <code> #<id>`; a stalled stream keeps re-nacking because
//     every subsequent inbound line re-triggers the same nack (S8.1 --
//     there is no periodic re-nack, 2026-08-26, S8.5) until a
//     well-formed line finally supplies
//     that same id (S8.9 -- "decode failure is a NAK", the central
//     2026-08-22 change: a corrupted leg of a multi-leg routine is
//     resent, not silently skipped).
//   - id < expectedNext_ : a stale retransmit -- the host never saw our
//     ack for something we already accepted. Do NOT re-execute (a
//     resent WHEELS_V must not drive the wheels twice, once motion
//     verbs land); reply `ack <expectedNext_ - 1> <lastDone> <reason>`,
//     the already-accepted id, not the resent one. `#0` is not
//     special-cased anywhere in this file: since expectedNext_ starts
//     at (and never goes below) 1, an inbound `#0` is unconditionally
//     `< expectedNext_` and falls into this bucket with zero extra code.
//   - id > expectedNext_ : a numeric gap -- discard, do NOT execute, and
//     do not even look up the verb; reply
//     `nack <expectedNext_> <lastDone> <reason>`. A gap stalls the
//     stream ON PURPOSE: every
//     subsequent command, however well-formed, is nacked identically
//     until the missing id arrives.
// A merits rejection -- the verb decoded fine but the Adapter refuses it
// on its own terms (e.g. an out-of-range value) -- is a DIFFERENT case
// from a decode failure: it ACKS and ADVANCES (the line arrived intact),
// paired with `err <code> #<id>` on top of that ack. Decode failure and
// merits rejection are the two cases S8.9 keeps sharply distinct.
//
// `<lastDone>`/`<reason>` are read FRESH off Adapter::lastDone()/
// lastDoneReason() every time an ack/nack is formatted (S8.8) -- there
// is no cached copy anywhere in this class. `err <code> #<id>` orders
// code first, id last (S8.6) -- the id is always a line's LAST token,
// commands and replies alike.
//
// HELLO/ESTOP/PING (S8.3) never carry an id at all and are maximally
// forgiving of trailing content -- see dispatch()'s own comment. HELLO
// additionally resets expectedNext_ (a (re)connecting
// host's own resync point) but does NOT touch the Adapter's
// lastDone()/lastDoneReason() -- that state is Adapter-owned and a
// handler-level reset has no business reaching into it (S8.8).
//
// Angles (rotation, omega) are milliradian integers on the wire
// (motion-api.md S9.1) -- decoded here with the ordinary signed-integer
// field parser, same as any other field; the degrees-at-the-API
// conversion is a LANGUAGE BINDING's job, not this file's.
//
// Host-portable by construction: no pxt.h, no CODAL type, anywhere in
// this file or wire_handler.cpp. See tests/host/wire_grammar_shim.cpp
// for the native host test harness this module is exercised through.
